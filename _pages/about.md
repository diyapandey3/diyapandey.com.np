## Hey- 
This is Diya, another human on this pale blue dot:-)

Diya is a keen tech and math zenthusiast. She loves to dive deep into the vastness of cosmos and want to explore more about it through quantum computing. She belives everyone should get equiatble opportunities and works to make it true. 

Feel free to connect with her. I believe that no matter how small it is, an act of kindness and initivative can make huge impact on lives of others. So, if you have been working on any such initivative, work or startup don't just say hello. Talk about books, politics, wellness and of course anyway you have been making small initiative to make impact on world.
